A really poorly-made BLT mod that possibly improves the sliders in Payday 2. To use it, install BLT and then copy the DelphyBetterSliders folder into the mod folder. I may make some additions / changes to this later down the line, since it's pretty simple at the moment.

Because this is most useful for accurately configuring your sensitivity (which is all I really made it for), I will provide some additional information regarding that usage. Payday 2's ratio of mickeys to degrees of camera rotation is 0.15. Source users can think of this number as Payday 2's (static) version of m_yaw. This means, for example, that you can calculate your Payday 2 sensitivity from your Source sensitivity by multiplying your Source sensitivity by m_yaw / 0.15.
